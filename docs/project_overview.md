# Project Overview

This project presents a full pipeline for analyzing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data from *Escherichia coli* (Sample: SRR2584863). It includes steps from quality control to variant annotation.

## Objectives

- Perform quality control (QC) on raw reads
- Trim low-quality reads and adapters
- Align reads to the reference genome
- Call and filter variants
- Annotate variants using SnpEff

## Data Source

- NCBI SRA Accession: `SRR2584863`
- Reference Genome: `Ecoliref.fna` (derived from *E. coli* K-12)

## Output

- Annotated variant list
- QC reports
- Summary statistics and visualizations
